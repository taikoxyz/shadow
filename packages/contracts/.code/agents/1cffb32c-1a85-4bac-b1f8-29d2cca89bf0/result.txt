This is my plan for reviewing the circuit-related code.

1.  **Understand Project Context:** I will begin by reading `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to get a high-level overview of the Shadow project, its goals, and its architecture. This will provide context for the circuit-related components.

2.  **Analyze Verifier Interfaces:** I will examine `src/iface/ICircuitVerifier.sol` and `src/iface/IShadowVerifier.sol`. This will help me understand the expected function signatures, return values, and events for circuit and shadow verifiers.

3.  **Review Verifier Implementation:** I will analyze the implementation of the shadow verifier in `src/impl/ShadowVerifier.sol`. I'll focus on the verification logic, how it interacts with the circuit verifier, and how it handles public inputs.

4.  **Inspect Public Input Handling:** I will review `src/lib/ShadowPublicInputs.sol` to understand how public inputs to the ZK circuits are structured and handled within the Solidity contracts. I will look for potential inconsistencies or vulnerabilities.

5.  **Examine Tests:** I will review `test/ShadowVerifier.t.sol`, `test/Shadow.t.sol`, and the mock verifier `test/mocks/MockCircuitVerifier.sol`. This will reveal how the system is being tested, what edge cases are considered, and the assumptions made about the circuit proofs.

6.  **Consult Security Documentation:** I will read the `claudedocs/nullifier-security-review.md` file to find any existing security analysis or identified issues related to the nullifier, which is likely a core component of the circuits.

7.  **Document Findings:** Finally, I will create a new file, `REVIEW_RESULT.md`, to document my findings. This report will outline the areas I've reviewed, any potential issues, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement I have identified. No other files will be modified.
