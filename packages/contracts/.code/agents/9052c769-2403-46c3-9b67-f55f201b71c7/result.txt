The review is complete. Here's a summary:

## Review Summary

**Files Analyzed:** 10 Solidity files + 1 existing security review document

**Key Findings:**

1. **POW Byte Order (Medium Risk):** The `powDigestIsValid()` function checks the lowest 24 bits of the `bytes32` when cast to `uint256`. This needs confirmation against the circuit's POW calculation to ensure they match.

2. **Zero Checkpoint Vulnerability (Medium Risk):** `ShadowVerifier.sol:29` doesn't check if the checkpoint exists. If `getCheckpoint()` returns zeros for a non-existent block, a malicious user providing `stateRoot = bytes32(0)` would pass validation.

3. **Block Number Truncation (Low Risk):** Block numbers are truncated from `uint64` to `uint48` when querying the checkpoint store, which could cause issues for very high block numbers.

4. **Nullifier Access Control (RESOLVED):** The critical vulnerability documented in `claudedocs/nullifier-security-review.md` has been fixed - the current implementation properly restricts `consume()` to the Shadow contract.

5. **Test Coverage Gaps:** Missing fuzz tests for serialization, boundary tests for block numbers, and tests for zero-checkpoint edge cases.

**Architecture is Sound:** The overall verification flow, validation ordering (checks before effects), and nullifier-based replay protection are correctly implemented.
